/*
Write a function that takes in a DNA string and returns an object describing how many of each type of nucleotide exist in the string. There are four types: "A". "C", "G" and "T". For example:
Example 1
Given the strand ACGT
The result for the letters "A C G T" is 1 1 1 1, respectively
Example 2
Given the strand GAG
The count of "A C G T" is 1 0 2 0, respectively
Example 3
Given the strand GGGCCT
The count of "A C G T" is 0 2 3 1, respectively
Extension:
If any letter other than the four types is given, throw and error to say "invalid DNA string you are not an organism!"
